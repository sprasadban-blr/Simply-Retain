1. Degree Distribution
2. Power Law Distribution
3. Total Possible edges = (n*(n-1))/2 
4. Density = #Edges_Exists/Total Possible edges
5. Clustering Coeffcient
6. Centrality Measure
    i. Closeness Centrality -- Shortest path from one node to another 
        Avg shortest path = Sum of all nodes shortest path/# of nodes (lower the average is better)
    ii. Degree Centrality = Degree of each nodes
    iii. Betweenness Centrality -- Want to measure Betweenness centrality for node 'X'
        Computer shortest path for every pair of nodes in Graph
        Sum(What percentage of shortest path between nodes passes through node 'X')
        To look 'X' is a gate keeper of that network or not ?
    iv. EigenVector Centrality -- Iterative technique from linear algebra
        Similar to Google page rank
7. Connectivity and Cohesion -- Minimum #of nodes to remove that makes seperation of graphs
8. Small Worlds: High clustering coefficients and Low average shortest path
    Random Graph Vs Regular Graph 
    i. Average Shortest Path = log(n) Vs n
    ii. Low clustering coefficients Vs High clustering coefficients
    iii. Small Worlds = Regular Graphs (remove few edges and add them back randomly)

9. Snowball Sampling -- Start with one node and keep building it (connections connection and so on..)
10. Random Sampling -- Randomly choose edges and keep building the network
11. Egocentric Network
